# FindThatAnime

  

You want an app that ulitilizes the Tracemoe api.  Want an app

that tells you what anime a screenshot is from.  Welp, here we have it.

FIND THAT ANIME.  This app allows you to submit screenshots and

tells you what anime it could be from with a similarity percentage

  

  

  

## Features

  

  

- Uses [TraceMoe](https://trace.moe), to find similar results to the screenshot inputed.

  

- Uses Anilist API, to return the title and other helpful information of the anime

  

  

  

## Installation

Ipa is available however, if you wish to install the project and edit it these are the instructions.

  

1. Fork the Repo or download the project to your computer

  

2. Congrats you (hopefully) should be done and can now open the `.xcodeproj` file that has been created within the directory
